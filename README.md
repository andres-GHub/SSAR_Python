# Self-similar aftershock rates (SSAR) model code
Python code used to carry out the statistical analysis of magnitude correlations published in https://npg.copernicus.org/articles/27/1/2020/npg-27-1-2020.html for the self-similar aftershock rates (SSAR) model presented in https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.94.022314, the catalog ("TimeMagLT.txt") used in the analysis, along with the data for the plots.
